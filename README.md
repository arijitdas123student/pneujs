### Teachable Machine Learning

Teachable machine is a web-based tool that can be used to generate 3 types of models based on the input type, namely Image,Audio and Pose.I created an image project and uploaded images of flowers which were taken from a [kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition).

### SashiDo

SashiDo is a lovely backend as a service platform with a plethora of built-in features. I just utilised the Files feature in my project to store photos provided by users.
